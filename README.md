[For beginners] This is the bare skeleton you need for a Discord bot - it covers most of the quirks of the Discord API that you normally need weeks to find out

# Instructions to install and run the bot:
1. Open the terminal and run `npm i` to install the packages
2. Open the `.env` file and enter your bot token there (you get it from the discord developer page)
3. Invite your bot to a guild by using this URL (insert client ID first): `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT ID HERE]&scope=bot&permissions=8`
4. Run the bot in the terminal by using `node .` or by double clicking the batch file
